Title: MRSL: A Causal Network Pruning Algorithm based on GWAS Summary Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lei Hou
Maintainer: Lei Hou <houlei@pku.edu.cn>
Description: when we have a marginal causal graph with its adjacent matrix,
    MRSL() perform a pruning algorithm to obtain a conditional causal graph;
    PLOT_NET() plot the graphical presentation of a graph based on igraph;
    kenDTau() and SPearF() evalulate the consistency between the estimated 
    and the true topological sorting.
